Software release at NASA is governed by <a href="http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?t=NPR&c=2210&s=1C">NPR 2210.1C</a>.
NPR 2210.1C establishes the roles, responsibilities, and
procedures for reporting, reviewing, and releasing software under various conditions, including open source.
Every center has a Software Release Authority (SRA). The SRA processes requests for software release and
coordinates legal, export control, IT security, 508 compliance, and software engineering standards
compliance reviews. Projects hoping to release software should contact their SRA early to discuss their goals
and begin the reporting, review, and release process.<br/><br/>
