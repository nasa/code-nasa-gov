    "Description": "Copies between local file systems are a daily activity. Files are constantly being moved to locations accessible by systems with different functions and/or storage limits, being backed up and restored, or being moved due to upgraded and/or replaced hardware. Hence, maximizing the performance of copies as well as checksums that ensure the integrity of copies is desirable to minimize the turnaround time of user and administrator activities. Modern parallel file systems provide very high performance for such operations using a variety of techniques such as striping files across multiple disks to increase aggregate I/O bandwidth and spreading disks across multiple servers to increase aggregate interconnect bandwidth.",

The program is especially suited for the analysis of fault-tolerant reconfigurable systems. The calculated bounds are close enough (usually within 5 percent of each other) for use in reliability studies of ultra-reliable computer systems. The SURE bounding theorems have algebraic solutions and are consequently computationally efficient even for large and complex systems. SURE can optionally regard a specified parameter as a variable over a range of values, enabling an automatic sensitivity analysis.",

The purpose of this research was to enable multiple microcontrollers to speak with eacho ther per the protocol specified in the preliminary release of EADIN BUS. EADIN BUS is a candidate for distributed control systems on aircraft engines. The primary use of this code was to assist in the modeling of small local networks which contain 16 or fewer nodes. This communication protocol differs from typical internet protocols by using a master node which distributes information between nodes through a call and response system. The RS-485 network is simplex and thus does not allow multiple nodes to talk at the same time. No time synchronization between  nodes is required for this network. These factors enable the master to request information from sensors and command actuators, one at a time. In the current implementation, no information is passed from individual nodes without first going through the master node. While other communication protocols do exist like ModbusMaster and simple-modbus, the speed of these communication protocols on the RS-485 network was not sufficient for our needs which required message send to reply receipt times of 1 millisecond. Additionally, the other protocols did not implement the same message system as specified by the preliminary documents regarding the EADIN protocol.",

    "Description": "Tool for Analysis of Surface Cracks (TASC) is a computer program created in MATLAB to enable easy computation of nonlinear J-integral solutions for surface cracked plates in tension by accessing and interpolating between the 600 nonlinear surface crack solutions documented in NASA/TP-2011-217480. The only required inputs are the surface crack dimensions (2c and a), plate cross-section dimensions (W and B), and linear plus power law material properties of elastic modulus, yield strength, and strain hardening coefficient. With the geometry and material parameters entered, TASC interpolates to the appropriate J(Φ) vs. crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) and far-field tension stress, σ, vs. CMOD solution, providing the full solution as CMOD ranges from zero out to the CMOD limit of the solution space for the given input parameters. TASC was developed by the Material and Processes Laboratory at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center.",

Archival mechanisms provide automatic version control of configuration files to aid in recovery in case of errant configuration. Validation mechanisms allow configuration files to be automatically checked for correctness before they are installed on all peer servers.",

Multi-threading is used to ensure that nodes are kept as busy as possible. Double buffering allows individual operations within a single task to be overlapped using asynchronous I/O. Multi-node cooperation allows different nodes to take part in the same task. Split file processing allows multiple threads to operate concurrently on the same file. Finally, additional optimizations such as buffer management help eliminate other bottlenecks that can reduce performance.

Mesh adheres to fundamental security principles and was designed to be compatible with strong security mechanisms including two-factor authentication, SSH bastions, and restrictive firewalls.

The architecture provides a secure, scalable and extensible communications and data system that supports all aspects of a mission from onboard processing through the Mission Operations Center (MOC) to public access on the Internet. The architecture includes an Application Programming Interface (API) and message bus to provide a publish and subscribe communication mechanism. The GMSEC architecture and source code are based on an enterprise architecture approach with a message-oriented cross-platform enterprise middleware (information software bus).",

Trick simulations are used all across NASA for simulations that support human spaceflight activities. However, until now, there were no means to use FMI based models in a Trick based simulation or a method for providing Trick based models that were FMI compliant. This software provides implementation software to do both. There are two principal components to the software: A C based software implementation for wrapping Trick based C models that provide an FMI compliant interface; A collection of C++ classes that can be used in a Trick based simulation to use an FMI compliant model (FMU).",

With it, you can read any version of the MRMS radar mosaics, past or present, and you can analyze, plot, subsection, and output custom mosaics of your own, which MMM-Py can ingest later. MMM-Py is free and open source. It is capable of producing publication-ready figures and analyses, but it also can do quicklook plots so you can check out the cool storm that just happened.",

This provides analysts with a coherent description of the anomalies identified in the sequence, and why they differ from more 'normal' sequences.",

The reason for having four different methods of FITS I/O with IDL is partly historical, as different groups developed the software independently. However, each method also has its own strengths and weakness for any particular task. For example, the procedure MRDFITS() -- which can read a FITS table into an IDL structure --is the easiest procedure for analyzing FITS files at the IDL prompt level (provided that one is comfortable with IDL structures). But mapping a table into an IDL structure includes extra overhead, so that when performing FITS I/O at the procedure level, it may be desirable to use more efficient procedures such as FITS_READ and FTAB_EXT.",

ALIAS consists of two processing subsystems for radiometric and geometric processing of the ALI’s multispectral imagery. The radiometric processing subsystem characterizes and corrects, where possible, radiometric qualities including: detector operability; gain; bias; coherent, impulse and random noise; signal-to-noise ratios (SNR); saturation levels; striping and banding; and the stability of detector performance. The geometric processing subsystem and analysis capabilities support sensor alignment calibrations; sensor chip assembly (SCA)-to-SCA alignments and related issues; geodetic accuracy assessments; modulation transfer function (MTF) characterizations; and perform image-to-image characterizations. The ALIAS also characterizes and corrects band-to-band registration, and performs systematic, precision and terrain correction of ALI images. The ALIAS can geometrically correct and automatically mosaic the SCA image strips into a seamless, map-projected image. The ALIAS was developed through collaboration between NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).",

The software uses an iterative, non-linear retrieval technique (optimal estimation). After the retrieval process has converged, the software performs an error analysis. The products of the software include all quantities needed to understand the information content of the measurement, its uncertainty, and its dependence on interfering atmospheric properties. Spectra from ground-based or space-based measurement with arbitrary observation geometry can be analyzed. The retrieved parameters can be chosen from a large set of atmospheric (e.g., volume mixing ratio of gases or aerosol optical depth), surface (e.g., Lambertian reflection), and instrument (e.g., spectral shift or instrument line shape parameters) parameters. The software uses an accurate, state-of-the-art, multiple-scattering radiative transfer code combined with an efficient polarization approximation to simulate measured spectra. The software enables fast and highly accurate simulations of broad spectral ranges by an optional parallelization of the frequency processing in the radiative transfer model. The framework was written with flexibility in mind. New algorithms and instruments are added by creating additional classes that implement the defined interfaces. Bindings are available for both Python and Lua.",

This functional paradigm for specifying a domain allows a clean separation between the domain of ontological modeling (i.e., the focus of the OMF Core Functional API) from specific bindings for standards-based technology frameworks such as W3C's OWL, OMG's UML/SysML and, potentially, others. More importantly, the functional nature of this OMF Core API allows decoupling algorithms for analyzing, constructing, auditing, verifying, reasoning about OMF ontological models independently of the particular technology in which these ontological models are represented.",

The capability is somewhat analogous to that of the C Standard Template Library but with important differences. Although the number of containers are expected to grow, the current supported cases are Vector, Map, and Set. Contained items can be of any intrinsic type or user-defined derived type. The user can also indicate that the contained objects are polymorphic and/or pointers with corresponding implications for the semantics of using those containers.",

Stochastic Reduced Order Models (SROMs) are low-dimensional, discrete representations of a given random vector being modeled that facilitate efficient stochastic calculations. SROMs can be viewed as a smart Monte Carlo method - using the concept for uncertainty propagation is similarly straightforward, but can significantly reduce computation time. An SROM is formed for a given target random vector by solving an optimization problem that determines it's parameters by minimizing the error between the statistics of the SROM and the target. Once the SROM is formed, it can be use to efficiently perform a probabilistic analysis. The SROMPy software package is a tool to solve the optimization problem efficiently to generate an SROM that can be used to propagate uncertainty through a given model.",

    "Description": "This tool includes three general types of scripts. The first one extracts average NDVI values from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 image collections for specified reference dates (typically a period of 10-15 years). Anomalies in NDVI values are then derived from Landsat 5 & 8 reference image collections from later dates (typically the year after the reference period to present). Various graphs and charts are produced showing positive and negative NDVI changes for specified points. The results are also visualized on the map as either areas of NDVI gain (displayed in green) or NDVI loss (displayed in red). The second types of scripts included scripts that perform unsupervised classifications to determine marsh extent for a variety of years and were made by applying a mask over the specified study area that incorporates elevation data to exclude regions over a specified height above average sea-level. These scripts require the user to choose classified pixel clusters that represent marsh land cover by using the Google Earth Inspector tab and then entering those values into the script to generate the marsh extent maps. Results of these scripts include classification maps for various years (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, etc.). The user can then decide to export those results into either their Assets or their Drive, or both. A third type of script is used for statistics regarding the classified maps generated in the classification scripts. These statistics include total pixel number and total marsh area calculated into square meters after the marsh extent pixels are clipped to our study area (the State of Maryland).",

And now you can explore the same Martian surface in your browser in an immersive WebVR experience. Access Mars features four important mission locations: the Landing Site, Pahrump Hills, Marias Pass, and Murray Buttes. Additionally, users can visit Curiosity's 'Current Location' for a look at where the rover has been in the past two to four weeks. And while you explore it all, JPL scientist Katie Stack Morgan will be your guide, teaching you about key mission details and highlighting points of interest.",
